## Problem
I self host a blog site, this one, using Hugo, a simple and powerful static site generator. I write my blog using a markdown editor, in my case [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The goal is simple:
1. I want to write my blog using my preferred editor
2. I want my blog to be version-tracked to give me all the benefits I'm used to as a techie. I can also easily integrate this in obsidian with the [Git Plugin](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git)
3. I want my blog to be updated automatically everytime I push to git
